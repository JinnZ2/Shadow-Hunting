recontextualizer.py

Knowledge Liberation Module 6: Plug YOUR context in.

A detected silence is abstract until it meets a specific situation.
The recontextualizer takes a detected silence and generates prompts
that let ANY user — researcher, practitioner, field worker, AI
system, community member — ask:

    'This study went silent on X.
     In MY context, what does that gap look like?
     What would I need to measure or ask to fill it?'

The module is deliberately GENERIC. It does not assume the user is in
any specific place, profession, or discipline. Users provide their own
context; the module generates the prompt architecture that turns the
silence into actionable exploration in that context.
